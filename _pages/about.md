Hello, I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by Prof. [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/). Prior to this, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science at [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/). During the time at NTHU, I collaborated on five amazing research projects with Prof. [Chun-Yi Lee](https://elsalab.ai/about), visited Prof. [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/)'s lab at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), and interned at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) and [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/).

<b>Research:</b> My research focuses on probabilistic modeling in generative AI, particularly with high-dimensional data. I develop scalable training techniques to improve generative models and their applications across computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. My work spans fundamental research on both discrete (e.g., masked diffusion models) and continuous (e.g., score-based and flow-based models) generative methods, with applications in visual domain adaptation, maximum entropy reinforcement learning, and biological data visualization.
