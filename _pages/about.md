Hello, I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by Prof. [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/). Prior to this, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science at [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/). During the time at NTHU, I collaborated on five amazing research projects with Prof. [Chun-Yi Lee](https://elsalab.ai/about), visited Prof. [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/)'s lab at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), and interned at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) and [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/).

<b>Research:</b> My research focuses on probabilistic modeling in generative AI, particularly with high-dimensional data. I'm developing scalable training techniques to enhance generative models and their applications in reinforcement learning (RL) and computer vision (CV). My research topics involve diffusion (score-based) models, flow-based models, energy-based models, visual domain adaptation, and maximum entropy RL.
